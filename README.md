### keras
Neural networks created with keras (and Tensorflow). Jupyter Notebook uses keras to train the model created here (as seen in the model.ipynb file).

### MNIST
Researched MNIST with C development using the Windows Subsystem (Linux). Reading in files and bytes.

### pandas
Managing Databases with a series of exercises, grabbing data from saved files etc. and tutorial videos on how to make your own databases to import into your file.

### Flask
flaskr.py application paired with a html file called drawingcanvas.html which opens the application in web browser and allows user to draw or clear and predict the number drawn. 
#### This is just a test file, it will be adapted into Jupyter Notebook with keras and model training in the next development stages.

### For personal use
Command for Ubuntu Terminal - cd /, then cd mnt/c/users/moech/desktop/4thYear/EmerTech/PythonTest, then python3 flaskr.py and open up Localhost:5000. 

### For user use
Follow the above instructions while navigating to your directory in which you saved the file and run python3 flaskr.py and then localhost:5000 in browser

## Errors 
tensorflowjs-converter is not recognised. This means that the model.json/model.h5 files were taken from https://github.com/bensonruan/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
